      <h2>Well look no further</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Below is a list of three bicycles you should consider.
          The first two are mass-produced but still maintain high
          production standards. The third is hand-made in Portland
          and custom tailored to individual dimensions. So, if you
          have Marfan's Syndrome, you might consider this a better
          option.

SPECILIZED
BIKE SPECS
2018 Men's Tarmac Pro: $6,000
- The FACT 10r carbon frame combines the lightweight performance and compliance of our top-end carbon production methods with our Rider-First Engineeredâ„¢ design that ensures every frame size has the same legendary climbing responsiveness and descending prowess you'd expect from a Tarmac.
- S-Works full FACT carbon fork with a tapered construction provides incredible front end stiffness and steering response for instantaneous accelerations and high-speed descents.
- A 52/36T S-Works alloy crankset is incredibly stiff, with a chainring grouping that's equally suited to big alpine climbs as it is to throwing down the gauntlet on the flats.
